## Managing Feeds

### Adding Feeds
Click the **+ Add Feed** button in the sidebar or use the feed management dialog. Paste any website URL - Reader will automatically find the RSS feed.

### Organizing with Folders
Create folders to group related feeds. Drag and drop feeds between folders, or assign them when subscribing.

### Import/Export
Use **OPML import** to bring in subscriptions from other readers. Export your subscriptions anytime to back them up or move to another app. **OPML export** is available in the feed management dialog.

## Tips

- Use **focus mode** (`f`) for distraction-free reading
- **Star** important articles to find them later
- The **iframe view** (`i`) shows the original website when article content is truncated

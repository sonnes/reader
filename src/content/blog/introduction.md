# Why I Built Reader

Google Reader shut down in 2013. I've been looking for a replacement ever since.

The alternatives never felt right. Most required accounts, subscriptions and didn't have the simple three-pane layout that made Google Reader so efficient.

So I got Claude & Friends to build Reader.

## What It Does

Reader is an RSS feed reader that runs entirely in your browser. No accounts. No servers storing your data. Your subscriptions live on your device, in IndexedDB.

The interface should feel familiar: folders and feeds on the left, article list in the middle, reading pane on the right. Navigate with your keyboard. Press `j` and `k` to move between articles. Press `?` to see all shortcuts.

## Getting Started

Click the **+ Add Feed** button in the sidebar. Paste a URL. Reader figures out the rest.

Organize your feeds into folders. Star articles you want to revisit. Everything stays local, loads fast, works offline.

That's it. No onboarding flow. No feature tour. Just an RSS reader that gets out of your way.
